## About the Project
![chriswebbdeveloper.co.uk](https://github.com/ChrisWebbDeveloper/chris-webb-developer-1/assets/19428849/380b3ab8-f84b-4f6f-b1d6-66fdf65a3aab)

The original build for the chriswebbdeveloper.co.uk, then named deanwebbdeveloper.com. A portfolio of my skills and projects, it utilises HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and a PHP mailer to present my current work and experience.

It includes links to examples of learned technologies, as well as other websites that were built. At the bottom of the website is a contact form that utilises PHP script to send said emails to myself.

This project also includes minified versions of the styling and script.
